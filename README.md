# Attendance-using-face-recognition
In this project, we employed the facial recognition concept to track student attendance and improve the system. The method works well in a variety of stances and variations. We attempted to propose a ground-breaking approach to attendance tracking that makes use of artificial intelligence tools. The goal of developing this system is to digitise the old method of recording attendance by calling names and keeping pen-and-paper records. The current methods for taking attendance are inconvenient and time-consuming. Manual recording allows for easy manipulation of attendance records. Traditional attendance systems and current biometric technologies are subject to proxies. As a result, we used the Smart Attendance Management System, which was created to address the shortcomings of traditional manual systems. Our research shows that using the recommended strategy, we can attain promising results.
